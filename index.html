# Migrating an office to 100% Work-From-Home

Mikael Kalms

CTO, Fall Damage

mikael@kalms.org

# About our team

- 20 people in one room
- Nearly everyone on a single project
- Project already in progress
- Strong team cohesion
- Experienced leaders in many areas

# This is not traditional work-from-home

We took an existing, functional team, and moved it to a 100% distributed development model.

It is not "everyone works from home on Wednesdays".

It is not "a few people work remotely".

It is not "a couple of studios collaborating".

It is "everyone is physically isolated from each other", due to external factors, with a pandemic approaching outside.


---

# Our strategy

Keep doing what we already are doing

Change how we do it, if necessary

Make sure people are informed during the transition
